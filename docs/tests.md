# Running the Tests

Prerequisites: ensure you have followed the instructions to install Poetry [here](running-locally/without-docker.md).

This project uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to run unit tests.

To run the tests from the command line, run `poetry run pytest`.

To run in VSCode:
* Run `Test: Refresh Tests` from the Command Palette.
* You can then run or debug tests by:
* Clicking the play button next to the test code
* Navigating to the VSCode `Testing` tab
